# Dockerfile for the Roboclaw container

# Start from the official ROS 2 Humble base image.
# This provides a clean environment with ROS 2 pre-installed.
FROM ros:humble-ros-base

# Set the default working directory for the container.
# Any subsequent commands (like RUN, CMD, ENTRYPOINT) will be executed from here.
WORKDIR /home/roboclaw

# Copy the local 'startup' directory into the image at the root directory.
# This makes your entrypoint script available inside the container.
COPY ./startup /startup

# Make the entrypoint script executable.
# Without execute permissions, the container won't be able to run the script.
RUN chmod +x /startup/roboclaw_entrypoint.sh
